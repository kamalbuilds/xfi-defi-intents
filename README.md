# CrossFi DeFi Intents

**Tagline:** Execute DeFi actions on CrossFi with your prompts.

## Overview
CrossFi DeFi Intents is an innovative platform designed to simplify and streamline DeFi interactions directly from your wallet using intuitive prompts. Built on the CrossFi Chain, a modular blockchain that combines the power of Cosmos and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it allows users to perform actions like staking, swapping, and more within a unified and secure environment.

## Problem Statement
Navigating the DeFi landscape often requires juggling multiple platforms, apps, and interfaces, leading to a fragmented and time-consuming user experience. Security concerns, complex processes, and high transaction fees can hinder the seamless management of assets.

## Solution Statement
CrossFi DeFi Intents addresses these challenges by providing a single, user-friendly interface within your wallet. Using natural language prompts, users can perform DeFi actions such as staking, swapping, and managing assets with ease. The platform integrates advanced transaction insights, security features, and automated notifications, ensuring a secure and efficient DeFi experience.

## Key Features

### 1. **Prompt-Based DeFi Actions**
   - Execute a wide range of DeFi transactions directly from your wallet using simple prompts. Whether it’s staking, swapping, or transferring funds, CrossFi DeFi Intents streamlines these processes into a few clicks.
   - **Example:** Input a prompt like “Swap 14 XFI for XUSD” and receive a wallet popup to execute the transaction seamlessly.

### 2. **Advanced Transaction Insights**
   - Gain valuable insights into each transaction, including built-in security checks and real-time warnings when interacting with unverified contracts.
   - If a user attempts to interact with an unverified contract, they receive a warning and must acknowledge it before proceeding, enhancing the safety of every transaction.

### 3. **Automated Security Notifications**
   - Stay informed with optional security notifications that remind you to revoke approvals and secure your assets directly from MetaMask.
   - Easily set up automated approval revocation alerts through the CrossFi dashboard without needing a signature.

### 4. **Native Coin Support**
   - Supports CrossFi (XFI), a utility coin that facilitates access to all dApps, products, and services on the CrossFi Chain, and Mint Power (MPX), a governance coin used for staking and fee payments within the ecosystem.

### 5. **Integrated Protection and Simulations**
   - Integrated transaction simulations and automated approval revoking notifications protect users from potential scams and unauthorized actions. This feature enhances user confidence in conducting DeFi transactions on the CrossFi Chain.
